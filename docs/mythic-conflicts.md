## üß† Usage Notes

- These mythic structures provide raw material for designing **symbolic modules** and **narrative-driven agents**.
- The character ontology will evolve into an **archetypal embedding space** for agent modeling.
- Conflicts will be mapped onto agent-environment interfaces in **complex systems** (using concepts like ergodicity, emergence, and rupture).

## üìå To-Do

- [ ] Add Lacanian interpretation of each core conflict
- [ ] Link each mythic narrative to possible state-space dynamics
- [ ] Tag each archetype with potential neural/symbolic module interfaces
- [ ] Translate core tables into CSV / JSON for model ingestion
